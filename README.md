# blank-webpages-with-javascript
A collection of blank webpages and their accompanying script source files, along with comments I felt like making.
Please don't bug me about the contents, I'm only bothering to upload stuff here in case the situation arises that I need to provide code samples for something.


# Disclaimer
If you think that some of the scripts running on the blank web pages look familiar, then they probably are.
I only bothered modifying the code to the point where it felt sufficient for me to understand the underlying logic.
Then I renamed some variables.
I trust that if you're one of those people then you understand that whatever a given page/script may resemble is likely dynamically generated in practice.

Everything here, past, present, future, is borne out of research and personal curiosity, and not for any tangible benefit.
